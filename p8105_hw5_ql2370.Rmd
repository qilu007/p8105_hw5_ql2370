knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
### Problem 1

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

set.seed(10)

iris_with_missing = iris %>% 
  map_df(~replace(.x, sample(1:150, 20), NA)) %>%
  mutate(Species = as.character(Species))

```

output = vector("list", length = 4)


```{r}
fill_in = function(x) {

  if (is.numeric(x)){
    x_changed = x %>% replace_na(mean(x, na.rm=TRUE))
}
  else if(is.character(x)){
  x_changed = replace_na(x,"virginica")
 
  }
  
  tibble(x_changed)
}
```




```{r}
output = vector("list", length = 5)
output = bind_cols(map(iris_with_missing, fill_in))
output

```




This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
